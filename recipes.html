	<p>Today I would like to share with you some benefits of my favourite salad that every student shoukd do every day. It is easy to cook, not expensive and helps to keep fit.</p>
	<hr>
		
	<section>
	<h3>What kind of salad?</h3>
	<p>I just want to remind you eating salad with cucumbers, tomatoes and greek cheese with some green stuff. Do you know why? These vegetables are rich with vitamins and helps our digestion, whilst cheese is a supplier of vitamins we need daily.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
		<li><i>1 Cucumber</i></li>
		<li><i>2 Tomatoes</i></li>
		<li><i>50 g Greek feta cheese</i></li>
		<li><i>40 g lettuce</i></li>
	    </ul>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h3>What benefits cucumbers have?</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>It helps you to keep fit because of its high water content;</li>
		<li>It helps you to keep your skin well-toned with a help of Vitamin A and stay hydrated;</li>
		<li>It protects our body from digestion problems, again, high water content and fiber;</li>
		<li>It is also said that cucumbers supply our bodies with vitamin C. There is no doubt we need this vitamin to to boost our immune system.</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>What about tomatoes?</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Tomatoes are effective source to defend against cancer;</li>
		<li>Rich with vitamins. Provide us with Vitamin C as well as well as Vitamin A, Vitamin K that is responsible for blood circulation;</li>
		<li>It helps your skin look better and improve your vision thanks to vitamin A;</li>
		<li>It helps our digestion too: removes toxins from our body and let it run on shedule so to say.</li>
		</ul>
	<h3> Is diary really healthy?</h3>
	<p>I would recommend you to add to your salad no more than 40-50 g of Greek feta cheese made of sheep or goat milk. Dairy poducts are well-known for being rich with Calcium which is responsible for our bone health. However, what other benefits does it have?</p>
	     <ul>
		 <li>It is a good source of protein. For those, who likes doing sports this kind of cheese could be really healthy as protein helps our muscle growth. Moreover, it strengthen our immun system;</li>
	     <li>It perfectly suits those who have digestion issues with cow milk;</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>To sum up...</h3>	
	<p>The simple is the best. Frankly speaking, I had no idea that such simple recipe with just a couple of ingredients can provide us with lots of vitamins and keep us healthy!</p>

	<p>There is no secret that all of us crave for some sugar especially when we are stressed! Seeing the tasty pastry in the bakery window makes it want even more! However, it would be better to bake it on our ownin case we want to save some money and enjoy the rusults of our cooking talent. </p>

		<h3>What do we need for baking?</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>Go to the supermarket and buy puff pastry roll. The good point is: you do not have to make the dough by yourself <s>oh, God, no,</s> and save some time for yourself.</li>
		<li>Do not forget about the filling. You may buy some fresh apples, lemon and cinnamon.</li>
		</ol>
    
	     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
			<li><i>1 puff pastry roll</i></li>
			<li><i>500 g apples</i></li>
			<li><i>1/2 tsp cinammon</i></li>
			<li><i>1/2 lemon</i></li>
			<li><i>50 g sugar</i></li>
		</ul>
	</section>
		
	<section>
	<h3>Let's bake it!</h3>
	 <ol>
		<li>Heat the oven up to 230 degrees C. We should place the pastry in the good preheated oven so to make our pies more fluffy.</li>	
		<li>Slice some apples. Put them into the bowl, combine with cinammon and add some lemon juice in the filling.</li>
		<li>Add the apple mixture to the skillet and cook it over medium-high heat. Add some sugar into the mixture.</li>
		<li>Cut the dough into small square pieces.</li>
		<li>When the mixture is thickened, add the filling on a square piece of dough and make a triangle out of it so that the filling does not come out while baking in the oven.</li>
		<li>Place the pies on a baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden.</li>
	</ol>
