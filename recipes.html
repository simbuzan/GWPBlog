		<h2>What do we need for baking?</h2>
		<ol>
		<li>Go to the supermarket and buy puff pastry roll. The good point is: you do not have to make the dough by yourself <s>oh, God, no,</s> and save some time for yourself.</li>
		<li>Do not forget about the filling. You may buy some fresh apples, lemon and cinnamon.</li>
		</ol>
    
	<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 puff pastry roll</li>
			<li>500 g apples</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp cinammon</li>
			<li>1/2 lemon</li>
			<li>50 g sugar</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Let's bake it!</h2>
	 <ol>
		<li>Heat the oven up to 230 degrees C. We should place the pastry in the good preheated oven so to make our pies more fluffy.</li>	
		<li>Slice some apples. Put them into the bowl, combine with cinammon and add some lemon juice in the filling.</li>
		<li>Add the apple mixture to the skillet and cook it over medium-high heat. Add some sugar into the mixture.</li>
		<li>Cut the dough into small square pieces.</li>
		<li>When the mixture is thickened, add the filling on a square piece of dough and make a triangle out of it so that the filling does not come out while baking in the oven.</li>
		<li>Place the pies on a baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden.</li>
		
	</ol>
