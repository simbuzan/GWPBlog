	<p>Hummus really is my favourite food! It is so fast and easy to make, I often eat it two or three times a week. Plus, it's super healthy! It has a lot of vitamins like calcium, magnesium and potassium, and lots of protein becaues of the chickpeas and the tahin. So it's a <strong>perfect meal</strong> for students who don't have a lot of time but want to stay healthy!</p>
	
	<h3>You need the following incredients:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Chickpeas, 1 can</li>
		<li>Tahin, 3 tbsp</li>
		<li>Olive oil, 2 tbsp</li>
		<li>Garlic clove, 1</li>
		<li>Lemon, 2 tbsp</li>
		<li>Cumin, 2 tsp</li>
		<li>Pepper, a tiny little bit</li>
		<li>Capsicum powder, 1 tsp</li>
		<li>Curry powder, 1/2 tsp</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>What to do:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Pour the chickpeas off the can through a sieve.<em> Save the juice, you will need it later!</em></li>
		<li>Mix all the incredients above in one bowl.</li>
		<li>Add some chickpea-juice. You have to experient a little bit, probably for one can of chickpeas you will need a little less then half of the juice. Add a little less at the beginning and see how it works out while mixing.</li>
		<li>Take a hand blender (other blenders will work as well, but I prefer hand blenders) and blend all the incredients till your hummus is smooth. It shouldn't be too liquid, but if you think it is too sticky, add some of the chickpea juice you saved before.</li>
		<li>Enjoy! Add some Naan bread or falafel to your hummus if you want to, or just enjoy it with some veggies.</li>
	</ol>
